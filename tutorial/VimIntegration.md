# Integrating it withing Vim

Integrating this setup with Vim is fairly easy.

1. Move *cryptwiki.vim* plugin somewhere in the Vim runtime path
2. Source the *cryptwiki.vim* file
3. (Optional) Install Async runner plugin to run the git command in the background (recommended: [asyncrun](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim))
4. Enjoy

## Example

For an example see my [neovim configuration](https://github.com/adriancostin6/neovim-config) specifically the mappings and plugins file.
